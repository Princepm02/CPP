# Integer Reversal Program

This C++ program reverses an integer entered by the user. It takes an integer input, reverses the digits, and then displays the reversed integer.

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system, such as g++.

2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you have saved the C++ file (e.g., `reverse_num.cpp`).

4. Compile the program using the following command:
   ```
   g++ reverse_num.cpp -o reverse_num
   ```

5. Run the program:
   ```
   ./reverse_num
   ```

6. Follow the on-screen instructions to input an integer.

7. The program will reverse the digits of the integer and display the reversed number.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how to use the Integer Reversal program:

```
Enter an integer: 12345

Reverse of Given Number = 54321
```
