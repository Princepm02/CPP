# Fibonacci Series 

This C++ program generates and displays the Fibonacci series up to a specified number of elements. The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, typically starting with 0 and 1.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system, such as g++.

2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you have saved the C++ file (e.g., `fibonacci.cpp`).

4. Compile the program using the following command:
   ```
   g++ Fibonacci.cpp -o Fibonacci
   ```

5. Run the program:
   ```
   ./Fibonacci
   ```

6. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the number of elements you want in the Fibonacci series.

7. The program will generate and display the Fibonacci series up to the specified number of elements.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how to use the Fibonacci Series program:

```
Enter the number of elements you want in Fibonacci series: 10

Fibonacci series: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
```
